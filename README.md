# SementicSegmenration
# DeepLabV3 trained on Synscapes dataset for more than 24 hours with resnet 18 backbone with dilation in last 2 layers. Key features of architecture are 1. Dilations to increase receptive field even further 2. Spatial pyramid pooling 3. Fusing features from low level in encoder-decoder style to get better resolution <br>

Here is the performance. mIOU > 84% on 19 classes. <br>
